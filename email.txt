Hi,
    Apology if you get this message more than once via different
channels.

We are going to try to restart the the Community of Edinburgh
Research Software Engineers (CERSE) after having stalled near the
start of the pandemic. The idea will be to alternate between physical
face-to-face meetings with changing venues across the university
of Edinburgh and virtual meetings on a monthly basis.  Thus the
seventh CERSE meeting and first after the pandemic will be held on
the 15/03/23 starting at 3pm in G.03, Bayes Centre,47 Potterrow,
Edinburgh EH8 9BT.  If anyone would like to volunteer a venue for
a future meeting, would like to be involved in the organisation of
such meetings or would like to speak then please get in touch.

Anyone who is involved with, or interested in, the development,
use, support or management of research software is very welcome to
attend.

Services. The following talks and activities have been scheduled:Â
